Trivial cases are sometimes important, so we mention briefly the case of the unit type~\unit.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:path-unit}
  For any $x,y:\unit$, we have $\eqv{(x=y)}{\unit}$.
\end{thm}

It may be tempting to begin this proof by $\unit$-induction on $x$ and $y$, reducing the problem to $\eqv{(\ttt=\ttt)}{\unit}$.
However, at this point we would be stuck, since we would be unable to perform a path induction on $p:\ttt=\ttt$.
Thus, we instead work with a general $x$ and $y$ as much as possible, reducing them to $\ttt$ by induction only at the last moment.

\begin{proof}
  A function $(x=y)\to\unit$ is easy to define by sending everything to \ttt.
  Conversely, for any $x,y:\unit$ we may assume by induction that $x\jdeq \ttt\jdeq y$.
  In this case we have $\refl{\ttt}:x=y$, yielding a constant function $\unit\to(x=y)$.

  To show that these are inverses, consider first an element $u:\unit$.
  We may assume that $u\jdeq\ttt$, but this is also the result of the composite $\unit \to (x=y)\to\unit$.

  On the other hand, suppose given $p:x=y$.
  By path induction, we may assume $x\jdeq y$ and $p$ is $\refl x$.
  We may then assume that $x$ is \ttt, in which case the composite $(x=y) \to \unit\to(x=y)$ takes $p$ to $\refl x$, i.e.\ to~$p$.
\end{proof}

In particular, any two elements of $\unit$ are equal.
We leave it to the reader to formulate this equivalence in terms of introduction, elimination, computation, and uniqueness rules.

The transport lemma for \unit is simply the transport lemma for constant type families (\cref{thm:trans-trivial}).
